#1. Assume that the time taken to bake a batch of cookies is normally distributed with mean 45 minutes and standard deviation 2 minutes.

#i. Generate a random sample of size 25 for the baking time.
baking_times <- rnorm(25, mean=45, sd=2)
baking_times

#ii. Test whether the average baking time is less than 46 minutes at a 5% level of significance.
#Hypothesis: H0: μ >= 46 vs H1: μ < 46
t.test(baking_times, mu=46, alternative="less")
#Conclusion:Since p value (0.0005364) is less than 0.05, we can reject H0 at 5% level of significance. Therefore, we can conclude that the true mean baking time is less than 46.
